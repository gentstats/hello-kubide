# 3.3 Collaborative Development Practices

**Emergency Mode (15 minutes)**: Use the Quick Team Setup and establish only the essential collaboration patterns.

## Purpose
Establish development practices that enable effective team collaboration, knowledge sharing, and collective code ownership while maintaining velocity and quality.

## The Collaboration Foundation

### Core Principles
1. **Collective Code Ownership**: Anyone can change any code
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: No single points of failure in expertise
3. **Continuous Communication**: Over-communicate rather than under-communicate
4. **Bias Toward Transparency**: Default to sharing information openly
5. **Psychological Safety**: Team members feel safe to take risks and make mistakes

## Quick Team Setup (15 minutes)

### Essential Collaboration Tools
```
Communication:
├── Real-time: Slack/Teams + voice/video capability
├── Async: Shared documents (Notion/Confluence)
├── Code: GitHub/GitLab with proper permissions
└── Planning: Linear/Jira with team access

Workflows:
├── Daily: Standup (15 min) or async check-in
├── Weekly: Code review sessions (30 min)
├── Bi-weekly: Architecture discussion (1 hour)
└── Monthly: Team retrospective (1 hour)
```

### Immediate Setup Checklist
- [ ] Create shared team calendar
- [ ] Set up code repository with branch protection
- [ ] Define code review requirements (1-2 reviewers)
- [ ] Establish communication response time expectations
- [ ] Create shared documentation space
- [ ] Set up pair programming/mob programming sessions

## Development Workflow Patterns

### Git Workflow Selection

#### GitFlow (Complex Products)
**Best For**: Teams with formal releases, multiple versions
```
Branches:
├── main (production releases)
├── develop (integration branch)
├── feature/* (new features)
├── release/* (release preparation)
└── hotfix/* (production fixes)

Process:
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Work on feature with regular commits
3. Create PR to develop when ready
4. Code review and merge
5. Create release branch when ready
6. Merge release to main and develop
```

#### GitHub Flow (Continuous Deployment)
**Best For**: Teams with continuous deployment
```
Branches:
├── main (always deployable)
└── feature/* (short-lived features)

Process:
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Work with frequent commits and pushes
3. Open PR early for feedback
4. Code review and discussion
5. Merge to main and deploy automatically
```

#### GitLab Flow (Staged Deployments)
**Best For**: Teams with multiple environments
```
Branches:
├── main (development)
├── pre-production (staging)
└── production (live environment)

Process:
1. Develop on main
2. Merge to pre-production for testing
3. Merge to production for release
4. Use merge requests between environments
```

### Code Review Framework

#### Effective Code Review Process
```
1. Author Preparation (5 minutes):
   - Self-review the changes
   - Write clear PR description
   - Add context and reasoning
   - Include testing information

2. Reviewer Guidelines (15-30 minutes):
   - Focus on logic, not style (automate style)
   - Ask questions, don't just point out problems
   - Suggest improvements, don't just criticize
   - Approve when ready, even if minor issues exist

3. Review Response (10 minutes):
   - Address all feedback or explain why not
   - Ask for clarification if needed
   - Thank reviewers for their time
   - Re-request review after changes
```

#### Code Review Checklist
```
Functionality:
- [ ] Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled appropriately?
- [ ] Is error handling adequate?
- [ ] Are security considerations addressed?

Design & Architecture:
- [ ] Is the code well-structured and maintainable?
- [ ] Does it follow established patterns?
- [ ] Are abstractions appropriate?
- [ ] Does it integrate well with existing code?

Testing & Quality:
- [ ] Are there adequate tests?
- [ ] Do tests cover the important cases?
- [ ] Is the code readable and well-documented?
- [ ] Are performance implications considered?
```

### Pair Programming Strategies

#### When to Pair Program
- **Complex Problems**: Multiple perspectives help
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Sharing domain expertise
- **Code Quality**: Real-time review and discussion
- **Onboarding**: Getting new team members up to speed
- **Critical Code**: High-risk or high-impact changes

#### Pairing Patterns
```
Driver-Navigator:
├── Driver: Types and implements
├── Navigator: Reviews, suggests, thinks ahead
├── Switch: Every 25-30 minutes
└── Communication: Constant dialogue

Ping-Pong Pairing:
├── Person A: Writes failing test
├── Person B: Makes test pass
├── Person A: Refactors code
└── Repeat: Switch roles each cycle

Mob Programming (3+ people):
├── Driver: Types (rotates every 15 min)
├── Navigator: Guides driver
├── Observers: Think ahead, research
└── Facilitator: Keeps process moving
```

## Knowledge Sharing Practices

### Documentation Strategy

#### Living Documentation
```
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):
├── Problem context and constraints
├── Options considered
├── Decision made and reasoning
└── Consequences and trade-offs

├── Auto-generated from code
├── Interactive examples
├── Error handling guide
└── Integration examples

Runbooks:
├── Deployment procedures
├── Troubleshooting guides
├── Incident response plans
└── Monitoring and alerting setup
```

#### Documentation Ownership
- **Code Comments**: Developer who writes the code
- **API Docs**: Backend team with product input
- **User Guides**: Product team with development review
- **Technical Docs**: Shared responsibility with rotating ownership

### Knowledge Transfer Mechanisms

**Framework Completion**: You've now completed all three phases of the foundational framework!

**Next Steps**:
1. **Implementation**: Start with Phase 1 to establish your foundation
2. **Iteration**: Refine and adapt based on your specific context
3. **Evolution**: Regularly review and improve your practices
4. **Sharing**: Contribute your learnings back to the framework

**Integration Guide**: All three phases work together:
- **Phase 1** provides business alignment and success criteria
- **Phase 2** establishes technical architecture and technology choices  
- **Phase 3** creates the development culture and practices for execution

Remember: This framework is a starting point. Adapt it to your team's specific needs, context, and constraints. The goal is practical implementation, not perfect adherence to any single methodology.
