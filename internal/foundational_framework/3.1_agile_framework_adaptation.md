# 3.1 Agile Framework Adaptation

**Emergency Mode (15 minutes)**: Use the Quick Process Setup and focus on your team's immediate workflow needs.

## Purpose
Adapt agile methodologies to fit your team's specific context, culture, and constraints while maintaining the core principles of iterative delivery and continuous improvement.

## The Agile Reality Check

### Before You Pick a Framework, Answer These:
1. **Team Size**: 2-3 people? 4-8 people? 9+ people?
2. **Experience Level**: First agile team? Some experience? Agile veterans?
3. **Stakeholder Style**: Hands-off? Collaborative? Micromanaging?
4. **Release Pressure**: Weekly releases? Monthly? Quarterly?
5. **Domain Complexity**: Well-understood? Exploratory? Highly technical?

## Quick Process Setup (15 minutes)

### Micro Team (2-3 people)
```
Daily Sync: 5-minute standup
Planning: Weekly 30-minute session
Review: End-of-week demo to stakeholders
Retrospective: Bi-weekly 30-minute discussion
Tools: Trello/Notion + Slack
```

### Small Team (4-8 people)
```
Daily Standup: 15-minute standup
Sprint Planning: 2-hour session every 2 weeks
Sprint Review: 1-hour demo every 2 weeks
Retrospective: 1-hour discussion every 2 weeks
Tools: Jira/Linear + Slack/Teams
```

### Larger Team (9+ people)
```
Daily Standup: 15-minute per squad
Sprint Planning: 4-hour session every 2 weeks
Sprint Review: 2-hour demo every 2 weeks
Retrospective: 1.5-hour discussion every 2 weeks
Coordination: Weekly sync between squads
Tools: Jira + Confluence + Slack
```

## Framework Selection Guide

### Kanban: The Continuous Flow
**Best For:**
- Support/maintenance teams
- Unpredictable work arrival
- Teams new to agile
- Operations-focused work

**Core Practices:**
1. **Visualize Workflow**: Board with To Do → In Progress → Done
2. **Limit WIP**: Maximum items in progress (usually 2-3 per person)
3. **Manage Flow**: Focus on completing work, not starting new work
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular reviews and adjustments

**Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Create visual board with workflow stages
- [ ] Set WIP limits for each stage
- [ ] Define "Done" criteria
- [ ] Establish daily standup cadence
- [ ] Schedule weekly flow review

### Scrum: The Time-Boxed Sprint
**Best For:**
- Product development teams
- Feature-driven work
- Teams that need structure
- Stakeholders who want predictability

**Core Practices:**
1. **Sprint Planning**: Plan 2-week iterations
2. **Daily Standup**: 15-minute sync on progress/blockers
3. **Sprint Review**: Demo completed work to stakeholders
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Improve team processes

**Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Define sprint length (1-4 weeks, recommend 2)
- [ ] Identify Product Owner and Scrum Master
- [ ] Create product backlog
- [ ] Plan first sprint
- [ ] Schedule all ceremonies

### Shape Up: The 6-Week Cycle
**Best For:**
- Small product teams
- Exploratory projects
- Teams that hate meetings
- Feature-complete products needing enhancements

**Core Practices:**
1. **Shaping**: 6-week cycles with 2-week cooldowns
2. **Betting**: Commit to work with appetite, not estimates
3. **Building**: Small teams work autonomously
4. **Circuit Breakers**: Hard stops prevent runaway projects

**Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Define shaping process
- [ ] Create betting table
- [ ] Form small building teams (2-3 people)
- [ ] Set cycle schedule
- [ ] Plan first 6-week cycle

## Custom Framework Builder

- Duration: [30min/1hr/1.5hr]

**Daily Sync** (Optional)
- Format: [Standup/Async update/Skip if team < 4]
- Duration: [5min/15min/30min]

### Step 3: Work Management (5 minutes)
Define your workflow:

**Backlog Management**
- Owner: [Product Manager/Tech Lead/Team]
- Prioritization: [Business value/Risk/Dependencies]
- Refinement: [Just-in-time/Weekly/Bi-weekly]

**Work Items**
- Size: [User stories/Tasks/Features]
- Estimation: [Story points/Hours/T-shirt sizes/None]
- Tracking: [Kanban board/Sprint board/Simple list]

## Common Agile Antipatterns & Solutions

### 1. Cargo Cult Agile
**Problem**: Following practices without understanding principles
**Solution**: Focus on principles first, adapt practices to context

### 2. Agile Theater
**Problem**: Going through motions without real improvement
**Solution**: Measure outcomes, not activity; retrospect on value delivered

### 3. Sprint Goal Amnesia
**Problem**: Losing focus on sprint objectives during execution
**Solution**: Daily reference to sprint goal; visible goal tracking

### 4. Backlog Bankruptcy
**Problem**: Massive, outdated backlogs that overwhelm planning
**Solution**: Regular backlog pruning; "Just enough" planning

### 5. Estimation Theater
**Problem**: Spending excessive time on estimates that aren't used
**Solution**: Right-size estimation effort to decision-making needs

## Metrics That Actually Matter

### Team Health Metrics
- **Psychological Safety**: Team confidence in speaking up
- **Learning Rate**: New skills/knowledge gained per sprint
- **Enjoyment**: Team satisfaction with work and process
- **Sustainable Pace**: Overtime hours, burnout indicators

### Delivery Metrics
- **Lead Time**: Idea to production timeline
- **Throughput**: Features delivered per timeframe
- **Quality**: Defects found post-release
- **Value**: Business impact of delivered features

### Process Metrics
- **Cycle Time**: Work item completion time
- **Flow Efficiency**: Time in active work vs waiting
- **Predictability**: Commitment vs delivery ratio
- **Waste**: Rework, meetings, context switching

**Next Step**: Proceed to [3.2 Quality Assurance Strategy](3.2_quality_assurance_strategy.md) to establish your quality practices.

**Integration Note**: Your agile process should support the architecture decisions from Phase 2 and accommodate the technology stack you've selected. The process rhythm should align with your deployment capabilities and stakeholder expectations.
