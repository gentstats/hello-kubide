# 2.3 Technology Stack Selection

**Emergency Mode (20 minutes)**: Use the Stack Decision Tree and focus only on your primary technology choices (language, database, deployment).

## Purpose
Select and validate technology choices that support your business goals while minimizing risk and maximizing team productivity.

## The 3-Layer Stack Decision Model

### Layer 1: Foundation (Core Infrastructure)
**Decision Timeline**: Week 1
- **Language/Runtime**: What you write code in
- **Database**: Where your data lives
- **Deployment**: How you get code to production

### Layer 2: Framework (Development Acceleration)
**Decision Timeline**: Week 2-3
- **Web Framework**: How you build APIs/UIs
- **Testing Framework**: How you ensure quality
- **Monitoring**: How you know what's happening

### Layer 3: Enhancement (Optimization & Scale)
**Decision Timeline**: Month 2+
- **Caching**: How you make things fast
- **Message Queues**: How you handle async work
- **Advanced Tooling**: How you optimize workflows

**Next Step**: Proceed to [3.1 Agile Framework Adaptation](3.1_agile_framework_adaptation.md) to customize your development process.

**Integration Note**: Your technology choices should align with the architecture decisions from [2.2](2.2_architecture_decision_framework.md) and support the domain boundaries identified in [2.1](2.1_domain_analysis_boundary_definition.md).
