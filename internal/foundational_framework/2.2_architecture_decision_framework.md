# 2.2 Architecture Decision Framework

**Emergency Mode (15 minutes)**: Use the Quick ADR Template and focus only on your biggest technical decision.

## Purpose
Create a systematic approach for making and documenting architecture decisions that supports both immediate needs and long-term evolution.

## The 5-Decision Priority Stack

### 1. **Data Flow Decision** (Most Critical)
- How does information move through your system?
- Where does data live and who owns it?
- What happens when data gets corrupted or lost?

### 2. **Integration Decision** 
- How do different parts of your system communicate?
- What happens when external services fail?
- How do you handle version changes in dependencies?

### 3. **Scalability Decision**
- What breaks first when you get 10x more users?
- How do you add capacity without downtime?
- What's your bottleneck elimination strategy?

### 4. **Security Decision**
- How do you protect sensitive data in transit and at rest?
- What's your authentication and authorization strategy?
- How do you handle security incidents?

### 5. **Deployment Decision**
- How do you safely release changes to production?
- What's your rollback strategy?
- How do you monitor system health?

## Decision-Making Process

### Phase 1: Problem Definition (30 minutes)
1. **Stakeholder Input** (10 min)
   - Who is affected by this decision?
   - What are their concerns and requirements?
   - What are the non-negotiables?

2. **Context Gathering** (15 min)
   - What's the business impact of delay?
   - What are the technical constraints?
   - What decisions depend on this one?

3. **Success Criteria** (5 min)
   - How will we know this decision worked?
   - What would make us reverse it?
   - When do we need to review it?

### Phase 2: Option Generation (45 minutes)
1. **Individual Brainstorming** (15 min)
   - Each team member generates 3 options independently
   - No discussion or evaluation yet
   - Include "do nothing" as an option

2. **Collaborative Expansion** (20 min)
   - Share all options without judgment
   - Build on each other's ideas
   - Identify hybrid approaches

3. **Option Refinement** (10 min)
   - Group similar options
   - Eliminate clearly inferior choices
   - Focus on 2-4 viable alternatives

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Decision (30 minutes)
1. **Impact Analysis** (15 min)
   - For each option, assess:
     - Implementation effort
     - Operational complexity
     - Risk level
     - Reversibility

2. **Decision Making** (10 min)
   - Use weighted scoring if needed
   - Consider "two-way door" vs "one-way door" decisions
   - Bias toward reversible decisions when uncertain

3. **Documentation** (5 min)
   - Create ADR immediately
   - Assign implementation owner
   - Set review date

## Common Architecture Patterns & When to Use Them

### Microservices
**Use When:**
- Team size > 8 people
- Different parts of system have different scaling needs
- You need independent deployment schedules
- You have mature DevOps practices

**Avoid When:**
- Small team (< 5 people)
- Unclear domain boundaries
- Tight coupling between services
- Limited operational expertise

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Use When:**
- Multiple systems need to react to the same events
- You need eventual consistency
- You want loose coupling between components
- You have complex workflows

**Avoid When:**
- You need immediate consistency
- Simple CRUD operations
- Limited team experience with async patterns
- Debugging complexity is a major concern

### Monolithic Architecture
**Use When:**
- Small to medium team
- Well-understood domain
- Simple deployment requirements
- Rapid initial development needed

**Avoid When:**
- Multiple teams working on same codebase
- Different parts need different technologies
- Independent scaling requirements
- Complex domain with clear boundaries

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**Use When:**
- Read and write patterns are very different
- High read volume with complex queries
- Need for different data models for reads/writes
- Event sourcing is already in use

**Avoid When:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Small scale applications
- Team unfamiliar with pattern
- No clear read/write separation

## Decision Review Framework

### Monthly Architecture Reviews
1. **Decision Health Check**
   - Are our ADRs being followed?
   - What decisions are causing pain?
   - What assumptions have proven wrong?

2. **Pattern Assessment**
   - Which patterns are working well?
   - What anti-patterns are emerging?
   - How can we prevent future issues?

3. **Learning Integration**
   - What have we learned this month?
   - How should this influence future decisions?
   - What knowledge gaps do we have?

### Quarterly Architecture Retrospectives
1. **Major Decision Review**
   - What were our biggest decisions this quarter?
   - Which ones had unexpected consequences?
   - What would we do differently?

2. **Technology Debt Assessment**
   - What technical debt have we accumulated?
   - What decisions are preventing us from moving fast?
   - What should we prioritize for next quarter?

3. **Evolution Planning**
   - How should our architecture evolve?
   - What decisions need to be revisited?
   - What new patterns should we explore?

## Tools & Templates

### Decision Impact Matrix
```
                Low Impact    High Impact
Low Effort     | Quick Win   | Major Win   |
High Effort    | Fill-in     | Big Bet     |
```

### Risk Assessment Template
```
Risk Level = (Probability Ã— Impact) / Reversibility

Probability: 1-5 (1=unlikely, 5=certain)
Impact: 1-5 (1=minor, 5=critical)
Reversibility: 1-5 (1=easily reversible, 5=permanent)
```

### Stakeholder Analysis
```
Stakeholder | Influence | Interest | Position | Strategy
------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------
Product     | High      | High     | Neutral  | Collaborate
Engineering | High      | Medium   | Support  | Involve
Operations  | Medium    | High     | Concern  | Consult
```

## Red Flags: When to Pause and Reassess

1. **Decision Overload**: More than 3 major architecture decisions pending
2. **Circular Dependencies**: New decision depends on undecided items
3. **Stakeholder Conflict**: No consensus after 2 discussion rounds
4. **Scope Creep**: Decision keeps expanding in complexity
5. **Analysis Paralysis**: More than 1 week spent analyzing

## Success Metrics

### Decision Quality Indicators

- Stakeholder satisfaction with decision process
- Technical debt accumulation rate

### Process Health Indicators
- Average time to make an architecture decision
- Number of decisions reversed within 90 days

**Next Step**: Proceed to [2.3 Technology Stack Selection](2.3_technology_stack_selection.md) to choose and validate your technical foundation.

**Emergency Escalation**: If decision-making is blocked, use the 24-hour rule: Document the blocker, notify stakeholders, and make a time-boxed decision within 24 hours to maintain momentum.
