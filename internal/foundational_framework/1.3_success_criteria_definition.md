# Success Criteria Definition (Step 3)
*Define winning clearly so everyone knows when we've won*

## The Problem with Traditional Success Metrics
Most projects fail because "success" means different things to different people. This step prevents that by creating shared, measurable definitions that everyone can rally around.

## Quick Success Definition (10 Minutes)

### The One-Metric Rule
Pick ONE primary metric that best represents project success:

**Revenue Projects:**
- Increase revenue by X% within Y months
- Reduce customer acquisition cost by X%
- Increase customer lifetime value by X%

**Efficiency Projects:**
- Reduce process time by X%
- Decrease manual effort by X hours/week
- Eliminate X% of support tickets

**Compliance/Risk Projects:**
- Achieve certification by [date]
- Reduce security incidents by X%
- Meet SLA requirements X% of time

**User Experience Projects:**
- Improve user satisfaction score by X points
- Increase feature adoption by X%
- Reduce task completion time by X%

### Supporting Metrics (2-3 maximum)
Choose metrics that support but don't conflict with your primary metric:

```
Primary: Increase online sales by 20%
Supporting: 
- Reduce page load time to <2 seconds
- Achieve 95% uptime
```

## Measurement Strategy

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Leading Indicators** (predict future success):
- Code quality trends
- Test coverage improvements
- User engagement with beta features
- Team velocity stability

**Lagging Indicators** (confirm past success):
- Revenue impact
- User satisfaction scores
- System reliability metrics
- Cost savings realized

### Measurement Timeline
```
Daily/Weekly (Development Phase):
- Build success rates
- Test execution results
- Team velocity tracking
- Blocker identification

Monthly (Delivery Phase):
- Feature delivery progress
- Quality metrics trends
- User adoption rates
- Performance benchmarks

Quarterly (Business Impact Phase):
- Business outcome achievement
- ROI calculation updates
- Strategic alignment review
- Long-term trend analysis
```

### Data Collection Plan
```
Automated Metrics:
[ ] System performance monitoring
[ ] Application usage analytics
[ ] Code quality measurements
[ ] Deployment success tracking

Manual Metrics:
[ ] User satisfaction surveys
[ ] Stakeholder feedback sessions
[ ] Team retrospective insights
[ ] Business impact assessments
```

## Red Flags and Course Correction

### Early Warning Signs
- Primary metric trending in wrong direction for 2+ weeks
- Supporting metrics improving but primary metric stagnant
- Team spending >20% time on unplanned work
- Stakeholder feedback contradicts metric results

### Response Strategies
```
If metrics are missing targets:
1. Investigate root causes (process, technical, or people issues)
2. Assess if targets were realistic
3. Consider scope adjustments
4. Increase measurement frequency temporarily

If metrics conflict with stakeholder satisfaction:
1. Validate measurement accuracy
2. Check for missing success dimensions
3. Reassess stakeholder expectations
4. Consider additional qualitative measures
```

### Success Criteria Evolution
**When to update criteria:**
- Fundamental business context changes
- Technical discoveries make targets impossible/trivial
- Stakeholder priorities shift significantly
- External factors (market, regulation) change requirements

**How to update:**
- Document rationale for changes
- Get explicit stakeholder agreement
- Maintain historical tracking
- Communicate changes to entire team

## Templates and Tools

### Success Criteria Template
```
PROJECT: [Name]
SUCCESS DEFINITION: [One clear sentence]

PRIMARY METRIC:
- Metric: [What we're measuring]
- Target: [Specific number/percentage]
- Timeline: [When we expect to achieve it]
- Owner: [Who's responsible for tracking]

SUPPORTING METRICS:
1. [Metric] - [Target] - [Timeline]
2. [Metric] - [Target] - [Timeline]
3. [Metric] - [Target] - [Timeline]

MEASUREMENT PLAN:
- Tools: [How we'll collect data]
- Frequency: [How often we'll review]
- Reporting: [Who gets updates and when]

SUCCESS CRITERIA REVIEW:
- Next review date: [When we'll reassess criteria]
- Trigger for emergency review: [What would cause immediate reassessment]
```

### Stakeholder Agreement Checklist
```
□ All stakeholders understand the primary metric
□ Everyone agrees on what constitutes success
□ Measurement approach is feasible with available tools
□ Timeline expectations are realistic
□ Responsibilities for tracking are clear
□ Process for updating criteria is defined
```

### Quick Health Check Questions
```
1. Can every team member explain the success criteria in one sentence?
2. Do the metrics directly connect to business value?
3. Can we measure progress weekly or more frequently?
4. Are we tracking both technical and business outcomes?
5. Do stakeholders agree this represents meaningful success?
```
