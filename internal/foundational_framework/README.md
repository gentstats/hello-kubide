## Quick Start Guide

### Emergency Mode (45 minutes total)
If you need to start immediately, use the emergency sections in each phase:

1. **Phase 1 Emergency (15 min)**: Answer 3 critical questions, identify 5 project killers, pick 1 success metric
2. **Phase 2 Emergency (15 min)**: Use Stack Decision Tree, create 1 ADR for biggest decision  
3. **Phase 3 Emergency (15 min)**: Set up basic workflow, establish essential collaboration tools

### Structured Implementation (1-2 weeks)
For comprehensive setup, follow the complete process:

**Week 1: Foundation & Architecture**
- Days 1-2: Complete Phase 1 (all three steps)
- Days 3-4: Complete Phase 2.1 and 2.2
- Day 5: Complete Phase 2.3

**Week 2: Delivery Excellence**  
- Days 1-2: Complete Phase 3.1 and 3.2
- Days 3-4: Complete Phase 3.3
- Day 5: Integration and team alignment

## How the Phases Work Together

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
├── Business Context → Informs architecture decisions
├── Risk Assessment → Guides technology choices  
└── Success Criteria → Validates delivery approach

Phase 2 (Architecture)  
├── Domain Boundaries → Structure team organization
├── Architecture Decisions → Enable technology selection
└── Technology Stack → Support development processes  

Phase 3 (Delivery)
├── Agile Processes → Align with architecture patterns
├── Quality Strategy → Support technology choices
└── Collaboration Practices → Enable team effectiveness
```

### Integration Points
1. **Business context drives architecture**: Domain boundaries align with business capabilities
2. **Architecture enables delivery**: Technology choices support agile practices  
3. **Quality spans all phases**: Quality considerations influence business, technical, and process decisions
4. **Continuous evolution**: All phases evolve together as you learn and adapt

## Framework Decision Trees

### Phase Selection Guide
```
What's your primary need?
├── Business Alignment Issues → Start with Phase 1
├── Technical Architecture Confusion → Start with Phase 2  
├── Team Process Problems → Start with Phase 3
└── New Project → Complete all phases in sequence
```

### Context-Based Approach Selection
```
Team Experience Level?
├── New to Enterprise Development → Use all emergency modes first
├── Some Enterprise Experience → Focus on comprehensive assessments
├── Experienced Team → Adapt framework to existing practices
└── Consultants/External Team → Emphasize documentation and handoff
```

## Common Anti-Patterns & Solutions

### Framework-Level Anti-Patterns
1. **Framework Worship**: Following every step religiously without context consideration
   - **Solution**: Adapt framework to your specific needs and constraints

2. **Phase Skipping**: Jumping to technical solutions without business foundation  
   - **Solution**: Always establish business context first, even in emergency mode

3. **Documentation Theater**: Creating extensive documentation nobody uses
   - **Solution**: Focus on decision-making artifacts that drive action

4. **Process Overhead**: Adding complexity that slows down actual work
   - **Solution**: Continuously evaluate and simplify based on value delivered

### Implementation Anti-Patterns
1. **Analysis Paralysis**: Spending weeks perfecting assessments
   - **Solution**: Time-box all activities and move to action

2. **Stakeholder Shopping**: Asking multiple people until you get desired answer
   - **Solution**: Identify decision-makers upfront and stick with their input

3. **Context Drift**: Letting business context change without updating approach
   - **Solution**: Schedule regular reviews and be willing to pivot

4. **Tool Obsession**: Focusing on tools instead of processes and outcomes
   - **Solution**: Choose simple tools that support your actual workflow

## Next Steps

**After completing Phase 1:**

1. **If using Rapid Delivery Track:** Move to immediate technical setup and first iteration
2. **If using Cost-Conscious Track:** Proceed to detailed cost-benefit analysis and tool selection
3. **If using Team Development Track:** Begin with team skill assessment and learning plan
4. **If using Governance Track:** Start architecture documentation and approval processes

**Regular Reviews:**
- **Weekly:** Check progress against success criteria and monitor high-impact risks
- **Monthly:** Review business context for changes and update risk assessments
- **Quarterly:** Validate approach is still optimal for context and risk landscape

## Support and Troubleshooting

### When Step 1 Gets Stuck
- **Stakeholders can't agree:** Schedule facilitated session with decision-maker present
- **Requirements keep changing:** Implement change control process
- **Context unclear:** Use pre-mortem technique to identify assumptions

### When Step 2 Gets Stuck
- **Too many risks identified:** Focus on top 3 highest impact and ignore the rest
- **Mitigation plans too complex:** Look for simpler approaches or accept some risks
- **Team paralyzed by risk analysis:** Time-box assessment and move to action

### When Step 3 Gets Stuck
- **Too many important metrics:** Force rank and pick top 3 maximum
- **Metrics hard to measure:** Start with proxy metrics you can measure
- **Stakeholders want different metrics:** Negotiate or escalate to shared decision-maker

### Getting Help
- Review the red flags sections in each step
- Use the emergency protocols if project becomes critical
- Consider external facilitation for stakeholder alignment issues

**Remember:** Perfect is the enemy of good. A simple, clear foundation beats an elaborate, confusing one every time.
